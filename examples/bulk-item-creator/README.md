# Bulk-item-creator

This project implements an administration panel in a Matrix instance which creates
project items according to the users specification.

It is based on the [matrix-ui-plugin-boilerplate-24 template](https://github.com/MatrixRequirements/matrix-ui-plugin-boilerplate/).

## Local build

Run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

In the `./dist` directory you'll find `BulkItemCreator.js`, as well as a map file
for more easily debugging TypeScript.

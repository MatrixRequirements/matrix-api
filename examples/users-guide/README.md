# User's Guide examples

The [Matrix Requirements SDK User's Guide](https://matrixrequirements.github.io/matrix-sdk-docs/) contains several code
examples. These are maintained here.

To run the examples, first run `npm install` in this directory.

Then, copy the file `credentials.json.TEMPLATE` to `credentials.json` and fill
in your Matrix Instance server URL and API Token value. Then you
can run the examples like so:

```
node ./list-projects.js
```

For more information consult the [SDK User's Guide](https://matrixrequirements.github.io/matrix-sdk-docs/)
